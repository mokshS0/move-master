# Move Master
Hi! I'm Moksh and I created this chess engine and GUI that allows you to play chess against a bot.

### Info
* Created in Python 
* Uses the Pygame Library to create GUI
* I used [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnYui0e73Rs&list=PLBwF487qi8MGU81nDGaeNE1EnNEPYWKY_&ab_channel=EddieSharick%28Eddie%29) by Eddie Sharick to help me create the engine (all 16 videos)

### Why? 
As a chess tutor, I created this application to keep my students enganged.
I love giving back to the community, expressing my creativity through problem sovling, and coding in general.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. Run ChessMain.py
3. Use z to undo a move and r to reset the game
